	 1.A graphics-based operating system interface that uses icons, menus and a mouse (to click on the icon or pull down the menus) to manage interaction with the system.
	 2.the flow of program execution is determined by events - for example a user action such as a mouse click, key press, or a message from the operating system or another program.
	 3.You can't add components “directly” to JFrame, you need to “obtain” its content pane. method.
	 4.A label does not react to input events. A JLabel object can display either text, an image, or both.
	 5.This is necessary because most Swing object methods are not "thread safe": invoking them from multiple threads risks thread interference or memory consistency errors.
	 6. the label only use to display text, image, where button is use to interact with user by the click motion
